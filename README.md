# deep@work

> *Code in Comfort. Live in Flow.*

**deep@work** is a *home-office / deep-work clothing line* designed for modern coders, remote workers, and creators who value **focus, comfort, and subtle tech identity**.

## Principles

1. **Coder-Centric Comfort**  
   Clothes you can wear for hours without distraction — ergonomic fits, breathable fabrics, soft seams.

2. **Functional Minimalism**  
   Minimal aesthetic, maximum utility — hidden pockets, tech-friendly features, clean lines.

3. **Subtle Tech Identity**  
   Insider coding references (`merge`, `focusMode`, `infiniteLoop`) without screaming “merch”.

4. **Versatile Presentation**  
   Wear it to your next stand-up *or* your midnight merge.

5. **Sustainability & Ethics**  
   Eco-friendly fabrics, ethical manufacturing, and built-to-last construction.
